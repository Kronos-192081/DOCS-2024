        <section id="course-overview" class="mb-5">
            <p>This course is designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding and practical skills
                necessary to enhance the performance and efficiency of diverse computing systems. Through a
                holistic approach, students will delve into various aspects of optimization techniques across
                multiple domains. The course begins by exploring strategies for optimizing multi-core and
                CPU-intensive programs, emphasizing the importance of efficient garbage collection
                mechanisms. Students will then advance to mastering techniques for optimizing multi-threaded
                applications and IO-intensive programs, with a focus on leveraging Just-In-Time (JIT)
                compilation for improved performance.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the course delves into database optimization methodologies, covering topics such
                as hardware support and caching mechanisms to enhance database performance. Students will
                also explore advanced concepts in network programming optimization, including the utilization
                of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to improve network efficiency. Lastly, the course provides
                insights into advanced machine learning (ML) optimization techniques, such as ML Operations
                (MLOps) frameworks like LORA and optimizations for Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA),
                enabling students to optimize ML workflows for efficient computation. By the end of the course,
                students will possess the expertise to analyze performance bottlenecks, devise optimization
                strategies, and implement solutions to enhance the efficiency and scalability of complex
                computing systems.</p>

            <p> You are permitted to talk to the course staff and to your fellow students about any of the problem sets.
                Any assistance, though, must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to
                a solution. Each student must write out his or her own solutions to the problem sets. Consulting another
                student's solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. These and
                any other form of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating.<br>
                <br>
                No collaboration is permitted on quizzes or assignments. All work submitted for the project must
                properly cite ideas and work that are not those of the students in the group. <u style="color: red;">
                    Simply stated, feel free to discuss problems with each other, but do not cheat. It is not worth it,
                    and you will get caught. In that case, we will be forced to award you no marks for that
                    assignment/quiz/project, take away 50% of your total final marks and you will risk deregistration.

            <p> If a personal emergency comes up that might impact your work in the class, please let the instructors
                know via a private chat message (to all the course instructors) so that the course staff can make

                very overwhelming, and all of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. </p>
